# Luxury Login Page

This project is a high-end, premium login page built using Python, Flask, HTML, CSS, and MongoDB. The design reflects a luxury aesthetic, simulating the look and feel of a sophisticated website.

## Features

- User authentication with MongoDB
- Elegant and responsive design
- Flash messages for user feedback

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.x**
- **MongoDB** (either local or a cloud instance like MongoDB Atlas)

## Installation Steps

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/luxury_login.git
cd luxury_login
```

### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

Create a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

### 3. Install Required Packages

Install Flask and Flask-PyMongo using pip:

```bash
pip install Flask Flask-PyMongo
```

### 4. Set Up MongoDB

1. **Local MongoDB**: If you are using a local MongoDB instance, ensure it is running.
2. **MongoDB Atlas**: If you are using MongoDB Atlas:
   - Create a new cluster.
   - Create a database and a collection named `users`.
   - Add a user with read and write access.
   - Obtain the connection string.

### 5. Update the Connection String

Open `app.py` and replace the placeholder `your_mongodb_connection_string` with your actual MongoDB connection string. Make sure to include the database name in the connection string.

```python
app.config["MONGO_URI"] = "your_mongodb_connection_string"
```

### 6. Create User Collection

You need to create a user in the `users` collection for testing. You can do this using a MongoDB client or MongoDB Compass. The user document should look like this:

```json
{
    "username": "testuser",
    "password": "hashed_password"
}
```

Make sure to hash the password using the `generate_password_hash` function from `werkzeug.security` before inserting it into the database.

### 7. Run the Application

Run the Flask application:

```bash
python app.py
```

By default, the application will run on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

### 8. Access the Login Page

Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`. You should see the luxury login page.

### 9. Login

Use the credentials you created in the MongoDB database to log in. If the credentials are correct, you will be redirected to a welcome page.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the HTML and CSS files to match your desired aesthetic. You can also expand the functionality by adding features like password recovery, user registration, etc.
